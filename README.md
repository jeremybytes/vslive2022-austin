## Description  
This repository contains slides and code samples for topics presented at Visual Studio Live! Austin (June 13-17, 2022)  

## Sessions

**TH04 - Get Func-y: Understanding Delegates in C#**  
Delegates are the gateway to functional programming. So lets understand delegates and how we can change the way we program by using functions as parameters, variables, and properties. In addition, we'll see how the built in delegate types, Func and Action, are waiting to make our lives easier. We'll see how delegates can add elegance, extensibility, and safety to our programming.

You will learn:
* What delegates are  
* How to use functions as parameters and return values  
* Make code that can be easily extended

* Sample Code: [TH04-delegates-in-csharp/](./TH04-delegates-in-csharp/)  

**TH11 - I'll Get Back to You: Task, Await, and Asynchronous Methods in C#**  
There's a lot of confusion about async/await, Task/TPL, and asynchronous and parallel programming in general. So let's start with the basics and look at how we can call asynchronous methods using Task and then see how the "await" operator can makes things easier for us. Along the way, we'll look at continuations, ConfigureAwait, and exception handling.

You will learn:  
* How to run code after a Task is complete  
* How to handle exceptions that occur in an asynchronous method  
* When to use "ConfigureAwait"

**TH17 - Better Parallel Code with C# Channels**  
Producer/consumer problems show up in a lot of programming scenarios, including data processing and machine learning. Channels give us a thread-safe way to communicate between producers and consumers, and we can run them all concurrently. In this presentation, we will explore channels by comparing parallel tasks with continuations to using a producer/consumer model. In the end, we'll have another tool in our toolbox to help us with concurrent programming.

You will learn:  
* How to understand the producer/consumer pattern  
* How to use channels to communicate between async methods  
* How to compare channels to Task continuations
